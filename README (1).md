# Project-1
'Vrinda Store' Data Analysis Project

**Project Details:**

In this project I have **cleaned** Vrinda store sales data and represented the the data using pivot charts in **Excel** answering questions such as: 
1) What are the top five states with most sales?
2) Which distribution channels are most effectively contributing to sales?
 and etc.

To conclude, I have also added **slicers** for Channel, categories and month for ease of access for further inspection and visualization.
